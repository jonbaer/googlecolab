        "**Swin Transformer** is a hirarchical vision transformer that was published in 2021 and selected as the best paper at ICCV 2021. Transformer has been extensively used in Natural Language Processing fields since **Attenion Is All You Need** paper came out in 2017 which uses **attention** mechanism. Many efforts have been made such as **ViT** to apply transformer to computer vision fields. The Vision Transformer(ViT) was successful in image classification but had drawbacks: 1) suboptimal for dense prediction such as semantic segmentation and object detection, 2) quadratic computational complexity to the input size due to the global attention computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges to apply Transformer from NLP to computer vision tasks comes from the intrinsic differences between the nature of them including 1) large variations in the scale of visual entities and 2) high resolution of pixels in images. Swin Transformer uses **hierarchical architecture** to address those issues where the represntation is computed with **S**hifted **win**dows.\n",
