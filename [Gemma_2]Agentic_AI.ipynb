Think of asking your smart speaker to play a song or a chatbot answering your customer service questions. They’re helpful, sure, but they’re fundamentally waiting for us to tell them what to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic AI, on the other hand, takes a fundamentally different approach. It’s all about giving AI the ability to proactively pursue goals, make decisions, and take actions in the world, even without explicit instructions every step of the way.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this post, you will learn how to construct an Agentic AI using Gemma 2 that dynamically develops the lore of a fictional game world. This AI agent actively expands and enriches the game’s history, ensuring a distinctive and ever-changing narrative experience for every player.\n"

        "Where Agentic AI truly shines is that they’re not just passively spitting out information. They can interact with digital (and potentially physical) environments, execute tasks, and make decisions autonomously to achieve their programmed objectives."
